# Phylogenetic_Tree_Tools

Scripts for: 

1) pruning taxa from multiple trees - designed to work with a directory filled with tree files


2) performing Robinson-Foulds comparisons for a set of trees to an optimal tree - uses a directory filled with tree files and a best tree file


3) calculating node-support indices - uses a directory containing RAxML bootstrapped output files to calculate the percentage of nodes with >70% bs support for each tree file
